I am writing to express my interest in the Associate role at IDinsight in Jakarta. With my background in Statistics and Economics and experience as a Research/Data Analyst across Indonesian sectors, I am well-positioned to contribute to IDinsight's mission of using evidence to improve lives at scale.

Throughout my work with Bank Indonesia, APEC, PT Pertamina, and KPPU, I have:
- Designed surveys and data collection methodologies
- Applied statistical modeling to solve complex problems
- Created dashboards to communicate findings effectively
- Conducted impact assessments for policy decisions

Most recently, I developed the Non-Cash Social Assistance Monitoring Survey for Bank Indonesiaâ€”experience directly relevant to IDinsight's work in social protection programs. My implementation study on food safety across APEC regions demonstrates my ability to translate data into actionable recommendations for diverse stakeholders.

My technical skills include programming (R, Python, SQL), statistical analysis (EViews, Stata, SPSS), and data visualization (Tableau, Looker). As an Adjunct Lecturer at Perbanas Institute and Assistant at IPB University, I've developed strong communication skills for explaining complex concepts.

I'm drawn to IDinsight's commitment to evidence-informed decision-making and direct impact on disadvantaged populations. Your approach of embedding within agencies to build data-driven systems aligns with my experience across multiple Indonesian sectors.

My qualifications directly match your requirements:
- Strong analytical skills demonstrated through outlier detection work for Bank Indonesia and NARDL modeling for KPPU
- Teaching experience that enables me to translate technical concepts into accessible formats
- Experience designing data collection systems for government surveys and impact assessments
- Proficiency in required software: R, Python, Stata, and SPSS
- Native Indonesian speaker with deep understanding of the local context

I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with IDinsight's mission and Jakarta team needs. I'm excited to apply my skills to support evidence-based policymaking in Indonesia. Thank you for considering my application.
