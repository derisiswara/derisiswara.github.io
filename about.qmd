## HelloðŸ‘‹

I am an experienced Data Analyst skilled at transforming raw data into actionable insights. Proficient in R, Python, SQL, STATA, EViews, Looker, Tableau, and Power BI. I focus on statistical analysis and data visualization to support informed decision-making. In addition, I am actively involved in research for academic journals, applying data analysis techniques to explore new methodologies and contribute to scholarly work. Iâ€™m open to collaboration and always eager to take on new challenges in the data world.


I am currently an Adjunct Lecturer with the Teaching Courses on Data Science in Perbanas Institute. I graduated from IPB University University in 2024 with a M.Si in Statistics and Data Science.


When not reading detective fiction or tinkering on stuff in Python or R, I occasionally do some volunteer teaching for the folks at The Carpentries.
