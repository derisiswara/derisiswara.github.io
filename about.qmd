## HelloðŸ‘‹

I am currently an Adjunct Lecturer at the Department of Data Science, Perbanas Institute. I graduated from IPB University in 2020 with a S.E. in Economics and in 2024 with an M.Si. in Statistics and Data Science. I enjoy grinding data with R and Python. I'm also proficient in various software tools including Tableau, Power BI, Looker, STATA, EViews, and others. I'm interested in econometrics and machine learning. My research has mostly been in finance, but I'm now shifting to applying machine learning in social sciences, particularly with microdata. I'm open to any collaboration, project, or new opportunity.
