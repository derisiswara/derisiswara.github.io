## Set Up Quarto

For the YAML header, you can use the following template in your main qmd file (`index.qmd`):

```yaml
title: "ESG and Firm Performance: Indonesian Evidence"
authors:
  - name: Your Name
    affiliation: Your University
    roles: writing
    corresponding: true
keywords:
  - ESG
  - Firm Performance
abstract: |
  This study examines the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance and financial ...
date: last-modified
bibliography: references.bib
number-sections: true
```

For the `_quarto.yml` file, you can use the following template:

```yaml
project:
  type: manuscript

manuscript:
  article: index.qmd

format:
  html:
    comments:
      hypothesis: true
  docx: default
  jats: default
```

You will also need a `references.bib` file in the same directory.

You can write your manuscript in index.qmd and do data analysis in different qmd files. You can embed results from a data analysis qmd file into `index.qmd`.

## Paper Topic

In this paper project, we will write a paper about the relationship between ESG and firm performance using machine learning. We will use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify the key factors that influence firm performance. 

In this documentation, I will showcase the package that I use, the steps I took to gather the data, and the integration of Zotero for my work.
