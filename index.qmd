<h1 style="font-size: 2.5em;">Hi! I'm <strong>Deri Siswara</strong> üëã</h1>
<p style="font-size: 1.3em;">Welcome to my portfolio garden. I am currently an Adjunct Lecturer in the Department of Data Science at the Perbanas Institute. I graduated from IPB University in 2020 with a B.Ec. in Islamic Economics and in 2024 with an M.Sc. in Statistics and Data Science. I enjoy working with data using R and Python. I'm also proficient in various software tools for data analysis. I'm open to collaborations, projects, or new opportunities. </p>
