## Hi there!

Welcome to My Website â€“ I'm Thrilled You're Here!

Iâ€™m a freelance economist and data scientist, with a deep passion for both fields. My academic journey spans  Economics (Bachelor of Economics) and Statistics & Data Science (Master of Science), reflecting my long-standing love for data and the economy.

Iâ€™ve finally found my sweet spot, working in the intersection of economics and data science, while connecting with brilliant people in the R and open-source communities.

Thank you for being a part of my journey. I'm not an expert in everything, but this space is where Iâ€™ll be sharing my learning experiences, and I hope you'll learn with me along the way!
